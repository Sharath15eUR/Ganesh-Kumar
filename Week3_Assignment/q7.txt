Purpose:
fork(): Creates a new process by duplicating the current process.
exec(): Replaces the current process's memory image with a new program.

Result:
fork(): Returns the PID of the child process in the parent process and 0 in the child process.
exec(): Does not return if successful; replaces the current process with the new program.

Creation of Processes:
fork(): Creates a new process by duplicating the current process.
exec(): Does not create a new process; replaces the current process's memory image.

Memory and Resources:
fork(): Duplicates the entire memory space and resources of the parent process to the child process.
exec(): Replaces the entire memory image of the current process with that of the new program.

Usage:
fork(): Used to create new processes, such as forking off child processes for parallel execution.
exec(): Used to execute different programs within the same process, commonly after forking a new process.
