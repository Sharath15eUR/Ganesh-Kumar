OUTPUT : 8

EPLANATION : 
integer occupies 4 bytes
char occupies 1 bytes
A=4 byte , B=1 byte , C=1 byte
Total 6 bytes is required for InfoData struct, since it is an 32 bit machine at an single clock cycle 4 bytes can be processed.
So struct uses an concept called padding which will make the memory allocation as per the processor bus width, it will be multiple of 4

address     1   2   3   4
4         | A   A   A   A
8         | B   C   x   x 

x => unknown data

So 8 bytes of memory will be occupied by InfoData,Eventhough it requires 6 bytes. Allocating 2 bytes of blank space.


PROGRAM :
#include <stdio.h>
typedef struct {
    int A;
    char B;
    char C;
} InfoData;

int main() {
    printf("Size of Structure = %zu\n", sizeof(InfoData)); 
    return 0;
}
