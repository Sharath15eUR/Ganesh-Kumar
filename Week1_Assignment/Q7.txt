OUTPUT : 16

EPLANATION : 
double occupies 8 bytes
char occupies 1 bytes
A=1 byte , B=8 byte , C=1 byte
Total 10 bytes is required for InfoData struct, since it is an 32 bit machine at an single clock cycle 4 bytes can be processed.
So struct uses an concept called padding which will make the memory allocation as per the processor bus width, it will be multiple of 4

address     1   2   3   4
4         | A   x   x   x
8         | B   B   B   B
12        | B   B   B   B
16        | C   x   x   x

x => unknown data

So 16 bytes of memory will be occupied by InfoData,Eventhough it requires 10 bytes. Allocating 6 bytes of blank space.

PROGRAM :
#include <stdio.h>
typedef struct {
    char A;
    double B;
    char C;
} InfoData;

int main() {
    printf("Size of Structure = %zu\n", sizeof(InfoData)); 
    return 0;
}
